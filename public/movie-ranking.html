<h3>Genius</h3>
<p>This is one of the best movies who love to watch thirelled & action movies. Its full of adventure. Its based on the a IIT student who have a great/brilliant mind or we say as a genius mind.</p>
<h3>Amawas</h3>
<p>Its a horror movie if you love 90's movies you can watch it...</p>
<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>Its a movie full of father and son love & nudity...most people loved it some says its a family show but I don't consider it as a family show.</p>
